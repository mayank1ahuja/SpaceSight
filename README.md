## **Overview of the Project**

Satellite operations are no longer driven by curiosity rather they serve as infrastructure nowadays. Space agencies, satellite operators, and ground-station networks require clear answers to operational questions: Which orbital shells are becoming most congested, and who is driving that growth? What is the age and mission-type composition of satellites in those crowded shells?

Thus this end-to-end analytics product was developed to answer these questions. Using the UCS Satellite Database, the project computes domain-relevant KPIs â€” growth rates, operator/country concentration, age, distribution of purposes within a group, and a practical density proxy and packages those insights in reproducible notebooks, canonical SQL, and an interactive Tableau workbook. The goal is to produce actionable intelligence for mission planners, regulators, insurers, and engineering leads.
